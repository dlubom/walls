The need for specific and sometimes unusual features has guided its development over the years. As the original programmer, my first goal was to make it possible for surveyors to handle the basic data management tasks for several long-running projects in Texas, Montana, and Mexico, each encompassing hundreds of linked caves and karst features. Walls is now being used to manage survey data for some of the largest cave systems in this hemisphere, including both the longest and deepest.</text></para>

For now I suggest opening the small example project, </text><text style="font-family:Arial; font-size:9pt; font-style:italic; color:#000000;" translate="true">Tutorial.WPJ</text><text style="font-family:Arial; font-size:9pt; color:#000000;" translate="true">, that Walls Setup installed. You&apos;ll see a tree diagram with a branch icon resembling a page. Double-click the page icon to examine a commented data file in the built-in editor. You may be able to modify it and start entering your data right away. The text editor in Walls is functionally similar to the basic editor that comes with Windows (Notepad). When the edit window opens, press F1 to see a description of the editor&apos;s features. </text></para>

Also be willing to reference the online help, which is quite extensive. &#160;If your habit is to explore without reading the documentation, and if you are sufficiently familiar with the Windows interface, you may be able to get by while missing a few tricks. (Whenever an unfamiliar dialog window appears, press F1 for instructions.) On the other hand, if you&apos;re considering extensive use of Walls you should browse through the entire help file at least once to get a feel for what&apos;s available.</text></para>

Our mapping software should support the creation of detailed cave maps that automatically track an ever-evolving survey database -- something that commercial CAD and illustration programs can&apos;t manage at all. The unique problem we face is that estimated passage locations change as successive surveying trips are made into the cave. New traverses will be averaged into the data set, possibly exposing blunders in old data. Therefore, it would be nice if we could quickly produce up-to-date maps, both for publication and field use, that are more than just computer-drawn line plots or crude passage representations. Ideally, the maps will show realistic passage outlines and complete decoration. I believe this goal has largely been achieved due to the availability of </text><link displaytype="text" defaultstyle="true" type="weblink" href="http://www.w3.org/Graphics/SVG/" target="_blank" style="font-family:Arial; font-size:9pt; text-decoration:underline; color:#0000ff;" translate="true">Scalable Vector Graphics</link><text style="font-family:Arial; font-size:9pt; color:#000000;" translate="true"> (SVG), a standard format that allows Walls to share the task of creating dynamic cave maps with a commercial drawing program.</text></para>
