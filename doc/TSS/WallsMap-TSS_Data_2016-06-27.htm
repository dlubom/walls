<p><font size="4"><strong>Note:</strong> This WallsMap release requires graphics technology available only in recent versions of
Microsoft Windows (Vista/7/8+/10). Windows XP is no longer supported.

<p><font size="4">Please download and install the latest WallsMap release prior to updating the database.
You can access this page for subsequent updates using a link in the program's About box. The TSS edition
is the same as the one publicly distributed except that the setup doesn't contain the <i>Texas Public Caves</i>
project. Also, the About box link will lead you here instead of to a
<a href="http://www.texasspeleologicalsurvey.org/software/wallsmap/wallsmap.php">download page</a>
on the TSS website.

A PDF version of the help file is also available and will be updated with each new build:

<p><font color="#990000" size="4"><strong>Note:</strong></font><font size="4">
Starting with release 2016-01-15, the project contains a version of Jerry Atkinson's Texas karst map created by Nancy Heger of TPWD. It's the top layer within the project tree's Geology folder.

<p><font size="4"><strong>Instructions</strong></font>
</p>
<p><font size="4">Download all three files to the same location (e.g., Desktop) and run the
executable, <i>TSS_Data_setup.exe</i>, which in turn processes the two .101 files if they are found. You'll be prompted for the destination folder of
the extracted data &#150; that is, the parent of the three project folders: <i>TSS_Data</i>, <i>TSS Maps</i>,
and <i>TSS Photos</i>. The first time you run this setup, a default location such as "C:\TSS" will be
displayed. For all subsequent installations the location previously used will be the default.
If you haven't done so, please review the section <i>Texas Speleological Survey Project</i>
in the WallsMap help file.</font></p>

<p><font size="4"><strong>Caution:</strong> If you're installing over an earlier
version of the database, folders <i>TSS Maps</i> and <i>TSS Photos</i> will
either be copied into (if that's your option), or completely replaced, leaving only the
image files linked to this project release. In folder <i>TSS_Data</i>, only the category
shapefiles (<i>TSS Caves</i>, <i>TSS Shelters</i>, etc.) will be replaced, but this means you'll
need to move (or rename by exporting) those existing files if they contain edits that haven't
yet been submitted.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">As with previous releases, the project contains a new database snapshot, a read-only shapefile
named <i>TSS All Types_2016-03-28</i>. At any time after you've made changes to any of the five category shapefiles
(<i>TSS Caves</i>, <i>TSS Shelters</i>, etc.), WallsMap's <i>Compare with other layers</i> function can use it to prepare
an update archive for submission to the database maintainer (currently Travis Scott and/or David McKenzie). If you've edited
records in the database since your last submission, please prepare a new update using your current snapshot before
installing this release. See <i>Submitting a Shapefile Update</i> in online help.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">A project file named <i>TSS_Data_2016-06-27.ntl</i> will also be
installed in <i>TSS_Data</i> and lanched when setup finishes. Your previous NTL file, however,
will still be available and you may well want to continue using it provided you add
<i>TSS All Types_2016-06-27.shp</i> as a layer. The difference is that it will now be linked
to shapefile layers that are up to date.</font></p>


<p><font nt size="4">If upon opening the project WallsMap displays a message box warning you that
a layer file couldn't be found, it's likely because you haven't installed some of the DEM/DRG
images linked to the project. These are assumed to be in a folder named <i>TSS_NTI</i> alongside <i>TSS_Data</i>.
If they're not there, just click the button that lets the program proceed without similar warnings.
(To avoid losing these image links, you can use the "Save as" feature to work with an incomplete version 
of the project.) You'll find links to the DEM/DRG images (and also to hi-res orthoimagery) in the
Help file under <i>Available Background Imagery</i>.</font></p>

<p><font size="4"><b>Additional TSS Data Files:</b> Also available is an optional
self-extracting archive containing a folder named <i>TSS Info</i>. With a structure similar to that
of <i>TSS Maps</i> and <i>TSS Photos</i>, it will contain various TSS documents that the Texas WallsMap
project may or may not link to directly, such as videos and PDF reports:</font></p>
