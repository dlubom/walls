This release contains an updated <b>OSM_Roads</b> shapefile and four new geologic map layers.
The project script (NTL file) now links to nine, non-visible geology shapefiles, all of which having been
set up for dynamic initialization of the ROCK_CODE field. Also, linked alongside each shapefile is an
<b>NTI image</b> for the corresponding geologic map, complete with collar information in some
cases. You'll be notified if these layers are missing when the project opens upon Setup completion.
Descriptions and download links for the geology files can be found in the WallsMap Help file, but
you can satisfy the new links by simply downloading the following archives, then moving the extracted
NTI files into the <i>..\TSS_NTI\Geology</i> folder. The shapefiles, however, are already in the project
setup and will be installed in folder <i>..\TSS_Data\Geology</i>.

</p><p>
The project also assumes that <a href="http://davidmck.fmnetdesign.com/GAT_250K.exe">GAT_250K.shp</a> (331 MB)
and <a href="http://davidmck.fmnetdesign.com/GAT_250K.nti">GAT_250K.nti</a> (433 MB) are both located in folder <i>..\TSS_NTI\Geology</i>. Note that the GAT image is much smaller than the 806 MB <i>gat.nti</i> you may already have. This new version has simply been recompressed with new parameters, the quality loss being hardly noticeable given what I started with. I would like to create it again with better original scans.
</p><p>When retrieving ROCK_CODE values, the GAT shapefile is used as the fall-back when feature locations aren't covered
by the regional geology shapefiles. In case they are, priority is determined by the search order that's specified in
the <i>.tmpshp</i> file of each category shapefile. For now, we're simply giving consideration to publication date when
more than one geologic map covers a region. You may decide we need to change the search order, which is now indicated by the ordering of those layers in the project tree.
</p><p>
When a new database snapshot is created by the database manager, all the ROCK_CODE field values
are subject to being "refreshed." This has been done in the latest release, which comes with new geology shapefiles.
In fact, our practice now is to always reinitialize this field for new records and for records whose locations
have changed. (Same as what's done for the PROTECTION field.) Therefore, if you believe the dynamically generated code is
incorrect for a feature you're adding or relocating, it doesn't help to manually override it. Instead,
you can note this map discrepancy in the GEOLOGY field.

<p>Another project change is removal of the read-only status of the TYPE field. This modification
of the .tmpshp file allows one to enter in the edit box something other than one of the
drop-down menu choices, which is still either <b>Cave</b>, <b>Sink</b>, <b>Cavity</b>, <b>Shelter</b>, <b>Spring</b>, <b>Entrance</b>, or <b>Other</b>.
The only purpose of this change is to keep the traditional <b>Undefined</b> category, shown in TSS website
statistics, where the actual feature type isn't known or was never specified. To indicate this, WallsMap
has displayed a value like "Cave?" in the  record's TYPE field. Here, "Cave" would have been simply a guess,
based on feature name alone, made by a program when the record was originally exported from Access. This allowed placement of the record in a specific category shapefile, perhaps one that would likely
be appropriate. Now we humans can make such a TYPE assignment, which is to append a question mark to one
of the menu choices while avoiding other kinds of edits.

<p><font size="4"><strong>Instructions</strong></font>
</p>
<p><font size="4">Download all three files to the same location (e.g., Desktop) and run the
executable, <i>TSS_Data_setup.exe</i>, which in turn processes the two .101 files if they are found. You'll be prompted for the destination folder of
the extracted data &#150; that is, the parent of the three project folders: <i>TSS_Data</i>, <i>TSS Maps</i>,
and <i>TSS Photos</i>. The first time you run this setup, a default location such as "C:\TSS" will be
displayed. For all subsequent installations the location previously used will be the default.
If you haven't done so, please review the section <i>Texas Speleological Survey Project</i>
in the WallsMap help file.</font></p>

<p><font size="4"><strong>Caution:</strong> If you're installing over an earlier
version of the database, folders <i>TSS Maps</i> and <i>TSS Photos</i> will
either be copied into (if that's your option), or completely replaced, leaving only the
image files linked to this project release. In folder <i>TSS_Data</i>, only the category
shapefiles (<i>TSS Caves</i>, <i>TSS Shelters</i>, etc.) will be replaced, but this means you'll
need to move (or rename by exporting) those existing files if they contain edits that haven't
yet been submitted.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">As with previous releases, the project contains a new database snapshot, a read-only shapefile
named <i>TSS All Types_2014-10-06</i>. At any time after you've made changes to any of the five category shapefiles
(<i>TSS Caves</i>, <i>TSS Shelters</i>, etc.), WallsMap's <i>Compare with other layers</i> function can use it to prepare
an update archive for submission to the database maintainer (currently Travis Scott and/or David McKenzie). If you've edited
records in the database since your last submission, please prepare a new update using your current snapshot before
installing this release. See <i>Submitting a Shapefile Update</i> in online help.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">A project file named <i>TSS_Data_2014-10-06.ntl</i> will also be
installed in <i>TSS_Data</i> and lanched when setup finishes. Your previous NTL file, however,
will still be available and you may well want to continue using it provided you add
<i>TSS All Types_2014-10-06.shp</i> as a layer. The difference is that it will now be linked
to shapefile layers that are up to date.</font></p>


<p><font nt size="4">If upon opening the project WallsMap displays a message box warning you that
a layer file couldn't be found, it's likely because you haven't installed some of the DEM/DRG
images linked to the project. These are assumed to be in a folder named <i>TSS_NTI</i> alongside <i>TSS_Data</i>.
If they're not there, just click the button that lets the program proceed without similar warnings.
(To avoid losing these image links, you can use the "Save as" feature to work with an incomplete version 
of the project.) You'll find links to the DEM/DRG images (and also to hi-res orthoimagery) in the
Help file under <i>Available Background Imagery</i>.</font></p>

<p><font size="4"><b>Additional TSS Data Files:</b> Also available is an optional
self-extracting archive containing a folder named <i>TSS Info</i>. With a structure similar to that
of <i>TSS Maps</i> and <i>TSS Photos</i>, it will contain various TSS documents that the Texas WallsMap
project may or may not link to directly, such as videos and PDF reports:</font></p>
