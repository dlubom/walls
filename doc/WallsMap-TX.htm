<p><font size="4"><strong>WallsMap v0.3 (Texas Public Caves Edition)</strong> &nbsp;
Build date: <font color="#990000"><strong>2014-08-20</strong></font></font></p>

<p><hr></p>

<p><font size="4">This version of the WallsMap setup contains
a preliminary GIS project named <i>Texas Public Caves</i>, one that's similar to the
karst database being maintained by the <a href="http://texasspeleologicalsurvey.org/">Texas Speleological Survey</a>.
This dataset might interest you if you would like to share data with the TSS,
or if you're developing a project where data of various kinds (reports, images, etc.)
are associated with point locations in Texas.</font></p>

<p><font size="4"><strong>Note:</strong> Graphics technology available only in recent
versions of Microsoft Windows (Vista/7/8+) is now a system requirement. Windows XP is no longer supported.
</font></p>

<p><font size="4">A PDF version of the help file is also available and will be updated with each new build:
<a href="WallsMap.pdf">WallsMap.pdf</a> (5.5 MB)</font></p>

<p><font size="4"><b>Sample Project Info:</b>
Upon finishing, the program's setup should open a sample project file named <i>Texas Public Caves.ntl</i>. At
the same location is an alternative project, <i>Texas Public Caves_DRG-DEM.ntl</i>, that has the links and settings
already set up for the DEM/DRG layers described in the help file under <i>Available Background Imagery</i>.
Those layers currently cover an area of 1177 7.5' USGS quadrangles. Before opening that project, you should
download and extract the corresponding files into a folder named <i>TSS_NTI</i> at the same level as <i>TSS_Data</i>.
