<H2>You have not yet compiled the Kakadu documentation</H2>

    On Unix/Linux/MAC platforms:

        First invoke the relevant makefile from <B>"coresys/make"</B> to
        build the core system -- this first step is not strictly necessary,
        but it allows you to build all applications (not just "kdu_hyperdoc")
        in the next step.
    </LI><LI>
        Next, invoke the relevant makefile from <B>"apps/make"</B>.  This
        will build all example applications and also build and run
        "kdu_hyperdoc", generating all HTML documentation and Java language
        bindings.
    </LI>
    </UL>

    On Windows platforms with .NET:
    <UL>
    <LI>
        First open the <B>"coresys/coresys.sln"</B> workspace and navigate to
        menu item "build->batch build", clicking "rebuild all" after checking
        both the "debug" and "release" versions -- this first step is not
        strictly necessary if you only want to run "kdu_hyperdoc", but it
        is required to build most of the applications later on.
    </LI><LI>
        Next, open the <B>"apps/apps.sln"</B> workspace and build the
        applications of interest.  To build and run "kdu_hyperdoc", it is
        sufficient to build only the "kdu_hyperdoc" project in the
        workspace -- a post-build operation will construct all HTML
        documentation, plus Java, C# and Visual Basic language bindings.  To
        batch-build all applications, go to menu item "build->batch build" and
        check only the release versions (fastest and smallest), or only the
        debug versions, then click "rebuild all".
    </LI>

    On Windows platforms with Visual C++ version 6:

        First open the <B>"coresys/coresys.dsw"</B> workspace and navigate to
        menu item "build->batch build", clicking "rebuild all" after checking
        both the "debug" and "release" versions -- this first step is not
