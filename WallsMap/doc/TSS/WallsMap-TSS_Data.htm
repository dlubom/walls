You can access this page for subsequent updates using a link in the program's About box. The TSS edition is the same as the one publicly
distributed except that the setup doesn't contain the <i>Texas Public Caves</i> project. Also, the About box link will lead you here
instead of to a <a href=" http://www.texasspeleologicalsurvey.org/Walls/WallsMap-TX.htm">download page</a> on the TSS website.

<p>This latest project release (2014-06-10) contains a new attribute field, ROCK_CODE, positioned adjacent
to ROCK_TYPE. It contains a geologic unit abbreviation extracted from four or five geologic map shapefiles,
and like COUNTY, QUADRANGLE, and ELEV_FT is set up to be maintained automatically as locations are revised.
This feature requires that you install <strong>WallsMap build 2014-06-11</strong> or later.
The first four shapefiles, which cover the Edwards Aquifer and Big Bend regions, are included in the project setup.
Optionally you can download a 331 MB archive, <a href="http://davidmck.fmnetdesign.com/GAT_250K.exe">GAT_250K.exe</a>,
containing a statewide geologic map shapefile. Adding that as a project layer, with <i>spatial indexing enabled</i>,
will allow efficient initialization of ROCK_CODE for points outside those regions. These shapefiles only need to
be present as layers. Visibility should normally be turned off.</p>
</LI>
<LI>
<p>In accordance with the practice we've adopted recently, this release contains a new read-only database snapshot, a shapefile
named <i>TSS All Types_2014-06-10</i>. At any time after you've made changes to any of the five category shapefiles
(<i>TSS Caves</i>, <i>TSS Shelters</i>, etc.), WallsMap's <i>Compare with other layers</i> function can use it to prepare
an update archive for submission to the database maintainer (currently Travis Scott and/or David McKenzie). If you've edited
records in the database since your last submission, please prepare a new update using your current snapshot before
installing this release. See <i>Submitting a Shapefile Update</i> in online help.</p>
</LI>
 <LI>
Starting with the 2014-05-05 project release, the NTL file contains a new section of DRG/DEM layers
in a folder named "Far West Texas." The download links for these files are in the <i>Available
Background Imagery</i> section of the online help.

<p><font size="4">Download all three files to the same location (e.g., Desktop) and run the
executable, <i>TSS_Data_setup.exe</i>, which in turn processes the two .101 files if they are found. You'll be prompted for the destination folder of
the extracted data &#150; that is, the parent of the three project folders: <i>TSS_Data</i>, <i>TSS Maps</i>,
and <i>TSS Photos</i>. The first time you run this setup, a default location such as "C:\TSS" will be
displayed. For all subsequent installations the location previously used will be the default.
If you haven't done so, please review the section <i>Texas Speleological Survey Project</i>
in the WallsMap help file.</font></p>

<p><font size="4"><strong>Caution:</strong> If you're installing over an earlier
version of the database, folders <i>TSS Maps</i> and <i>TSS Photos</i> will
either be copied into (if that's your option), or completely replaced, leaving only the
image files linked to this project release. In folder <i>TSS_Data</i>, only the category
shapefiles (<i>TSS Caves</i>, <i>TSS Shelters</i>, etc.) will be replaced, but this means you'll
need to move (or rename by exporting) those existing files if they contain edits that haven't
yet been submitted.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">A project file named <i>TSS_Data_2014-06-10.ntl</i> will also be
installed in <i>TSS_Data</i> and lanched when setup finishes. Your previous NTL file, however,
will still be available and you may well want to continue using it provided you add
<i>TSS All Types_2014-06-10.shp</i> as a layer. The difference is that it will now be linked
to shapefile layers that are up to date.</font></p>

<p><font nt size="4">If upon opening the project WallsMap displays a message box warning you that
a layer file couldn't be found, it's likely because you haven't installed some of the DEM/DRG
images linked to the project. These are assumed to be in a folder named <i>TSS_NTI</i> alongside <i>TSS_Data</i>.
If they're not there, just click the button that lets the program proceed without similar warnings.
(To avoid losing these image links, you can use the "Save as" feature to work with an incomplete version 
of the project.) You'll find links to the DEM/DRG images (and also to hi-res orthoimagery) in the
Help file under <i>Available Background Imagery</i>.</font></p>

<p><font size="4"><b>Additional TSS Data Files:</b> Also available is an optional
self-extracting archive containing a folder named <i>TSS Info</i>. With a structure similar to that
of <i>TSS Maps</i> and <i>TSS Photos</i>, it will contain various TSS documents that the Texas WallsMap
project may or may not link to directly, such as videos and PDF reports:</font></p>

Instructions are displayed when this setup is run.</font></p>
