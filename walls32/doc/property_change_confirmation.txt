First, after inspection of the code I now see why there's no confirmation dialog for committing valid changes to the properties pages whenever you move to a different branch. This would require quite a few code changes in various places. (For example, some property changes are detected only when "backing out" would be difficult given the way the code is structured.) I doubt that it's really worth the trouble given that this GUI concept for modeless dialogs is not unheard of -- I see it often in various guises. Right now you're just prevented from making invalid changes, or prompted if changes would involve the moving of files, etc. Note that merely clicking on a different properties tab will also commit valid changes on the current tab without prompting. If you still find this problematic, let me know. I may be revising these code sections soon anyway. (The sudden disappearance of the Review dialog is actually a different problem that I intend to fix.)
