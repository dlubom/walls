Dimitri -- Manifold employee:

I have to admit the following staggered me:

“I think that users should not read help files at all these days ! ”

I sincerely wish you the best of luck with that viewpoint, and just as sincerely hope you never buy another manifold.net product. :-) … there are some points where people of good faith must simply agree to disagree.

I don’t know a single example of a sophisticated software package designed to accomplish sophisticated tasks that could be efficiently learned and utilized to remotely near its capabilities without reading documentation, at least not for 99% of humans.

Perhaps the classic example is watching a beginner flail away at PhotoShop, just trying to draw a straight line. No doubt nearly everyone on this forum could come up with similar examples of indisputably world-class packages that require reading of documentation and some study to master: Visual Studio, Illustrator, whatever.

One reason such packages have an initial learning curve is that GUIs which are totally self-documenting (such as certain Wizard GUIs) tend to be highly self-limiting and ultimately frustrating for users who are not abject beginners. Assuming your audience is a sophisticated bunch that will be using the package on a regular basis to do sophisticated things, you need to design your GUI to provide maximum efficiency and ease of use to the experienced user. That’s often quite a different GUI than one which is very easy to learn by a beginner and which automates simple tasks.

I grant you there are some extraordinary geniuses who can get the hang of complex things astonishingly quickly. And there are some very patient people who like puzzles who will spend days and weeks puzzling out interfaces without reading documentation. But for most people, getting real value out of a sophisticated package in sophisticated settings requires reading help.

This is just as true of Manifold products as it is of ESRI products. I just do not believe that the average beginner new to GIS can sit down and do anything sophisticated with ArcGIS without reading documentation. In fact, anecdotal evidence indicates it takes quite a bit of reading and study for beginners to gain proficiency in ArcGIS. This is expected, as it would be for any large package.

I have noticed, however, that almost invariably when I hear criticism that “Manifold’s GUI is difficult and ArcGIS is easy” it comes from someone who has spent a lot of time and effort mastering ArcGIS and has not bothered to spend the same amount of time and effort learning Manif0ld. This is an intellectual disconnect and is not any evidence as to which GUI is easier to learn.

The best evidence of which GUI is easier to learn usually comes from people who come into the situation cold. Because of the low cost of Manifold, we have very many more people coming into GIS cold than does ESRI. Those who have not tried ESRI of course cannot give a comparative estimate of the relative difficulty of learning ESRI packages compared to Manifold, but we do have a large number of people who have tried to learn ESRI, failed, and then found Manifold easy to learn.

Any pollster would tell you that there is self-selection bias in such a sample, because obviously those who found ESRI’s GUIs easy to learn would not have been looking for an alternative. So you can only infer so much from such anecdotal evidence. But from years of customer reactions, tech support incidents, many tens of thousands of wishlist items maintained in product planning databases, considering responses only from those people who have learned both ESRI and Manifold the overwhelming majority say they think Manifold is easier to learn and easier to use.

Your experience and opinion is obviously not with that majority. But, I am not convinced your approach is a typical approach because if you really think serious GIS can be done without reading help files or that significant GIS tasks can be done “in just 5 minutes even by the most inexperienced users”, well, I just don’t believe that is a world view that matches the way most people, inexperienced or not, approach GIS.

By the way, the focus of all this should not be exclusively on “simple tasks,” because if only “simple tasks” are of interest you need neither Manifold nor ArcGIS. Use MapPoint or some other very simple tool, such as a web-based application. My comments here are about the sophisticated tasks, such as topology overlays of various kinds, for which people need a full-power GIS. Yes, if you want a package that can do only trivial things it is easy to design a GUI that is trivially easy to learn, without requiring the reading of much documentation. I don’t think an exclusive interest in trivial things is the prime focus of the audience that reads this blog.

I am wondering if you ever faced a situation to run a department in which most people are not native English speakers or not English speakers at all !!!
In such a case I wonder how is it possible for somebody who does not now English to read a help file ! I had to deal with a lot of people in the past who had just very basic understanding in English language and had to perform GIS tasks and I can tell you that they were doing fine with the ArcGIS series. I am not talking for older versions of the Arc/Info software (ie 7.x) that the GUI was built in AML (and didn’t follow windows-like standards) that were difficult to learn.

I have discussed the issue of functionality efficiency of both Manifold and ArcGIS with people and all the opinions I got so far were against Manifold. I asked a lot of times company owners of whether they would invest in Manifold and the answer was no. Some of them that bought Manifold found out that most of their production-lines were almost destroyed.

Perhaps you come from an environment that English language is spoken but this is not necessarily the case for every place in the Globe we live :-)

As far as it concerns my opinion about ‘Users should not read help files these days’, I still believe it. Basically I am a developer. I develop software for GIS more than 10 years now. I have never used the help of Visual Studio for finding out how to perform a task. I am not saying I have never used help for finding out features of a specific language such as C#. But never for finding out how to perform tasks. The Visual Studio GUI is self evident. And this is because it is very well designed. That is the case for ArcGIS. It is self evident. You may end up having a tool window open in which you need to know more about the 3 options that provides in order to perform a task, basically because these 3 options reflect 3 different methods, but you do not need to read help in order to learn how to bring up the tool window ! This is the big difference between Manifold and ArcGIS. You do not need to read help that describes how to bring up tools / windows / etc …

I am not saying help files should become obsolete. But for sure I am saying that portions of help describing how to end up bringing up tools need to become obsolete. It is more or less the same like having a webpage in which you need to read a help file on order to interact with. Would you use a
