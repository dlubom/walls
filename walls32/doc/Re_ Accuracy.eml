Mike,

It's great that you managed to get some feedback from someone who truly
understands the problem.

Yes, this is what I meant by the sentence containing "statistically similar".
For clarity, maybe we should replace that sentence with the following
paragraph:

============================
Walls converts a set of measurements, such as distance, azimuth, and vertical
angle into an "observed" vector displacement between two unknown points. To
obtain least squares estimates for the points and other statistics required to
compute confidence intervals, the observation should ideally be weighted by
the inverse of the 3 x 3 covariance matrix of the vector's error. A good
approximation for the error's covariance matrix is hard to obtain for cave
surveys due to important sources of error that are either unknown or highly
dependent on circumstances (error standard deviations for station positioning,
compass, clinometer, and tape measurements), or otherwise difficult to account
for at all (uncaught mistakes and systematic errors). For this and other
reasons besides mathematical convenience, the covariance matrix is roughly
approximated by a diagonal matrix in which the nonzero elements (variances)
corresponding to the two horizontal components have the same size. Also, all
three variances are made proportional to the observed vector's length. The
rationale for adopting, by default, this simplified model for error variance
is discussed in more detail in the Walls documentation under the topic "Choice
of Mathematical Model".
============================

I'm not sure I understand the distinction between mathematical models that
lead to "precise estimates" and mathematical models that lead only to
"indicators". A model for error variance can be a better approxmation of
reality and can result in *better* least squares estimates (using more of the
information in a data set). A model can also be more complex or "fine grained"
than the application or data quality justifies, not leading to significantly
better estimates. Since people will disagree on what's appropriate for cave
survey data, I plan to revise Walls to optionally support more complex models.
It's something that will interest a few of us at least. :)

Thanks. Yes, the t  in "t distribution" should be lower case while the F in "F
distribution" should remain upper case.

Here is another correction to the accuracy reports that I sent you. In the
paragraphs describing how to compute confidence intervals, change "computed as
plus or minus 1.64 x SD_H" to "computed as the estimated value plus or minus
1.64 x SD_H".
