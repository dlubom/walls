Mike,

For the time being, I'm suggesting we include the following statements =
in the metadata outline. Please condense or revise them as you see fit. =
Note that the vertical accuracy report is similar but not quite =
identical. To complete the quantitative positional attribute fields =
(Accuracy Value and Accuracy Explanation) we can either say that no =
specific value is applicable to the entire data set (explanation: =
confidence intervals will vary with station location and are provided in =
the station shapefile), or we can actually provide the SDUW (square root =
of the UVE) as a metric quantity, identifying it as the scale factor =
used to compute a posteriori confidence regions. Recall that the UVEs =
are already provided in the metadata tables derived from the .DEF files. =
The advantage of entering N/A, or just referring to the shapefiles,  is =
that it doesn't have to change with each data submission.

In the shapefile structure definition, I'll probably use 8.2 numeric =
fields for SD_H/V and SDUW_H/V, and 5-character fields for LOOPS_H/V =
(100,000 loops surely being unlikely). I won't bother you now with the =
details of why I'm suggesting this form for the accuracy assessments. =
Certainly there are other possibilities.

Let me know whether or not this is enough for now. I've been slowly =
digging through some incredibly complex code that I haven't seen in =
about 10 years. I can barely recognize it as something I've written.

Horizontal Positional Accuracy Report:

When weighting compass and tape traverses for least squares adjustment, =
the default error variance assumed (by Walls) for each horizontal =
component is <total traverse length in feet>/100 ft=B2, which is =
equivalent to a standard deviation of 0.3 m for a 30-meter vector =
measurement. This being only a rough approximation of variance, the =
component errors are currently treated as if they were statistically =
similar and uncorrelated. Under these assumptions the expected =
horizontal unit variance estimate (UVE) resulting from an adjustment is =
1.0. Cave surveys, however, are significantly affected not only by =
random errors in clinometer and tape readings, but also by station =
positioning errors and systematic errors due to imperfect instrument =
calibration (among other things). Cave difficulty and skill of surveyors =
are important factors. When there are sufficient surveyed loops, the =
effects of these errors normally result in UVEs ranging from 1.0 to 2.0 =
in surveys believed to be of good quality. (CRF surveying methods and =
standards are assumed.)

The accuracy of a station's estimated UTM coordinates will depend on its =
distance from well-established benchmarks and how much control is =
provided by surveyed loops. Approximate confidence intervals can be =
computed from statistics derived from the least squares adjustment and =
error analysis. The required statistics are provided in the following =
numeric fields of the station shapefile:

SD_H      - A priori standard deviation of each horizontal component's =
error in meters.
SDUW_H    - A posteriori standard deviation of unit weight for each =
horizontal component.
LOOPS_H   - Loop count (degrees of freedom) for each horizontal =
component.

(Note that the standard deviation of unit weight is the square root of =
the UVE.) These numbers can be used to derive any of several popular =
kinds of approximate confidence intervals. For example, an a priori =
bound on either the Easting or Northing of a UTM position, at 90% =
confidence, would be computed as plus or minus 1.64 x SD_H. The radius =
of an approximate 90% confidence region would be 2.15 x SD_H. These =
intervals depend only on network geometry and the default variances used =
for weighting measurements. To obtain the corresponding a posteriori =
confidence interval, which depends on observed consistency (loop =
closures), we would replace SD_H with with SDUW_H x SD_H. This will be a =
legitimate confidence interval only if the loop count is large enough, =
say over 20 (generally the case for CRF data submissions to MCNP). For =
fewer loops, the radius of a confidence region can be computed using =
critical values of the F distribution, with 2 and 2 x LOOPS_H degrees of =
freedom. If there are no loops, only a priori bounds are possible.

Vertical Positional Accuracy Report:

When weighting compass and tape traverses for least squares adjustment, =
the default error variance assumed (by Walls) for the measured vertical =
component is <total traverse length in feet>/100 ft=B2, which is =
equivalent to a standard deviation of 0.3 m for a 30-meter vector =
measurement. Under this assumption the expected vertical unit variance =
estimate (UVE) resulting from an adjustment is 1.0. Cave surveys, =
however, are significantly affected not only by random errors in =
instrument and tape readings, but also by station positioning errors and =
systematic errors due to imperfect instrument calibration (among other =
things). Cave difficulty and skill of surveyors are important factors. =
When there are sufficient surveyed loops, the effects of these errors =
normally result in UVEs ranging from 1.0 to 2.0 in surveys believed to =
be of good quality. (CRF surveying methods and standards are assumed.)

The accuracy of a station's estimated elivation will depend on its =
distance from well-established benchmarks and how much control is =
provided by surveyed loops. Approximate confidence intervals can be =
computed from statistics derived from the least squares adjustment and =
error analysis. The required statistics are provided in the following =
numeric fields of the station shapefile:

SD_V      - A priori standard deviation of the vertical component's =
error in meters.
SDUW_V    - A posteriori standard deviation of unit weight for the =
survey's vertical component.
LOOPS_V   - Loop count (degrees of freedom) for the survey's vertical =
component.

(Note that the standard deviation of unit weight is the square root of =
the UVE.) These numbers can be used to derive any of several popular =
kinds of approximate confidence intervals for an established elevation. =
For example, an a priori 90% confidence interval would be computed as =
plus or minus 1.64 x SD_V. This interval depends only on network =
geometry and the default variances used for weighting measurements. To =
obtain the corresponding a posteriori confidence interval, which depends =
on observed consistency (loop closures), we would replace SD_V with with =
SDUW_V x SD_V. This will be a legitimate confidence interval only if the =
loop count is large enough, say over 40 (generally the case for CRF data =
submissions to MCNP). For fewer loops, the confidence interval can be =
computed using critical values of the T distribution with LOOPS_V =
degrees of freedom. If there are no loops, only a priori bounds are =
possible.
