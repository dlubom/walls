I like better the approximation used by default in Bob Thrun's program, CMAP, where a vector's three component variances are assumed equal but still a function of some presupposed target positioning error and angle standard deviation.  The result is that a traverse consisting of 10 30-meter shots is considered more error prone than one consisting of 15 20-meter shots.  This makes sense if random errors in compass and clinometer readings are indeed the predominant source of traverse error when shots are of sufficient length.  But even allowing this, is there enough improvement here, practically speaking, to drop the supremely simple "variance is proportional to traverse length" rule that Walls uses by default?  This is the same rule, by the way, that underlies the historically popular "compass rule" adjustment.
