David -

I had a brainstorm this morning and sent the station metadata to Peter
Schweitzer, who helped develop the metadata standards and wrote a lot (all?)
of the USGS-FGDC metadata software.  He has been deeply involved since the
mid-90s.

Below is his response (my original request at end).

There are some questions that only you (certainly not me) can answer.  Can
you take a look and let me know how to respond?  Thanks.

Mike

Mike,

Glad to hear from you.  Hope things are going well.

I think your description of the situation is pretty good.

It wouldn't be a bad thing to have your summary of the
quality (in your note to me) as a preface to the more
detailed statement in the positional accuracy reports.

Note that you don't have to have a Quantitative Horizontal
Positional Accuracy Assessment at all; the _Report is good
enough.  I assume that by "statistically similar" you mean
that the observations are assumed governed by the same
probability density...?  In essence I interpret that to mean
you treat them as random samples of the same stochastic
process, so that you can derive summary statistics from
them.  But I also understand from the way it's written that
this is only a mathematical convenience and that people
should not use the resulting statistics as though they were
precise estimates; they're indicators.

It's a small point, but the "T distribution" is usually
written lower-case, as "t distribution".  Maybe I took
too _many_ stat courses!

You mention that some of the (problematic) variability in
the survey data is attributable to different groups of people
doing the survey work.  But it looks like "who did the survey
and when" is not included in the data, at least not in the
attributes described.  It might be useful to put something
into the Logical_Consistency_Report indicating how many
different surveyors worked on the data, and possibly some
idea of how much of the data were done by each.  It could be
as general as "lots of different people each doing a small
part" vs. "three main surveys covering 90% of the cave with
twelve more doing the remaining 10%"; something to give the
user a sense of this source of variability.

Other comments on the metadata:

Dates in the Time_Period_of_Content should be of the form
YYYYMMDD; you can omit the times.  My guess is that the dates
in this element aren't publication dates but represent the
time span during which surveys were conducted; that should
be what is written in Currentness_Reference if true.  Normally
if the Currentness_Reference is publication date, the
Time_Period_Information won't be a Range_of_Dates/Times but
will be a Single_Date/Time.

Note that there are two identical Contact_Address elements
within the Point_of_Contact.

If you know the names of your surveyors, they could go into
Data_Set_Credit, but this is optional.

I never use Publication_Time; just leave it out.

In describing the attributes, I wouldn't use Unrepresentable_Domain
for these numeric values; that's what Range_Domain is for.
Nearly all of these should be converted into Range_Domains.
Unrepresentable_Domain is really only for strange situations
that aren't measurements, counts, categories, or descriptive
text.  Yours are mostly measurements.

I would use Metadata_Access_Constraints rather than Metadata
Security_Information to describe who can get the metadata.
Assuming it's something like "Internal use only by CRF and
NPS personnel, not for redistribution"; that's an appropriate
place to put it.  And of course if the data become available
in the future, you can change it.

I hope this is helpful.  Please let me know how it goes,
especially if I can provide additional information or
assistance.

Peter
